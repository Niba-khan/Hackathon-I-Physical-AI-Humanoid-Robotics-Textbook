# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics - AI-Native Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This resource is designed for beginner-to-intermediate students learning about robotics, artificial intelligence, and humanoid robot control.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is organized into four core modules that progressively build your understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **[Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./content/modules/001-ros2-fundamentals/intro.md)** - Learn about the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware that connects different robotic components.
2. **[Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](./content/modules/002-digital-twin/intro.md)** - Explore physics-based simulation and high-fidelity visualization for robot development.
3. **[Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](./content/modules/003-ai-robot-brain/intro.md)** - Discover perception, synthetic data, VSLAM, and navigation for humanoid robots.
4. **[Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./content/modules/004-vla/intro.md)** - Integrate LLMs with robotics for language-driven actions.

Each module includes hands-on exercises and validation checklists to reinforce your learning.
