# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview
This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware that connects different components in robotic systems. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure for sensors, actuators, and computational nodes in humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what ROS 2 is and why it's important for humanoid robots
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Get familiar with rclpy for Python-based ROS 2 programming
- Understand URDF basics for robot modeling

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts

## Topics Covered
- ROS 2 architecture and concepts
- Message passing in robotics
- Creating and running nodes
- URDF for robot modeling

## Hands-on Tasks
By the end of this module, you will complete practical exercises to:
- Create two nodes that communicate via topics
- Implement a service for request-response communication
- Modify a simple URDF file to represent a humanoid robot
- Create a Python script linking a Python agent to ROS 2
