# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview
This module covers the AI systems that form the "brain" of humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac. You'll learn about perception, synthetic data generation, visual SLAM (VSLAM), and navigation for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem and its role in humanoid robotics
- Learn about Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data
- Explore Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM
- Implement Nav2 for bipedal humanoid path planning

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics simulation (covered in Module 2)
- Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac and Isaac Sim
- Synthetic data generation workflows
- Visual SLAM (VSLAM) principles
- Isaac ROS packages and integration
- Nav2 navigation for humanoid robots

## Hands-on Tasks
By the end of this module, you will complete practical exercises to:
- Build a basic Isaac scene with sensors
- Implement VSLAM using Isaac ROS
- Execute simple Nav2 navigation for a bipedal humanoid
