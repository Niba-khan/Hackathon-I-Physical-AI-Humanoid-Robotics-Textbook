# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview
This module integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotics for language-driven actions. You'll learn to implement a pipeline that processes voice commands through Whisper transcription to cognitive planning and ROS 2 action execution.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Vision-Language-Action (VLA) concepts and LLM integration
- Learn to implement Whisper-based voice input processing
- Design cognitive planning that maps natural language to ROS 2 actions
- Execute a full autonomous humanoid task cycle in simulation

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of ROS 2 (Module 1)
- Knowledge of simulation (Module 2)
- AI/ML concepts (Module 3)

## Topics Covered
- Vision-Language-Action system architecture
- Whisper for voice command transcription
- Cognitive planning for action sequences
- Natural language to ROS 2 action mapping
- Capstone: full autonomous task pipeline

## Hands-on Tasks
By the end of this module, you will complete practical exercises to:
- Implement Whisper voice input processing
- Convert natural language commands to ROS 2 action sequences
- Simulate the full flow: voice → plan → navigate → identify → manipulate
